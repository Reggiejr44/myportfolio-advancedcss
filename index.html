      </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="flex-row">
        <p>I am a seasoned professional with 2+ years of project leadership and marketing experience in the business sector. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for community outreach, as well as for creating avenues for process optimization and profit growth, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career. As such, I have consistently exceeded budgetary and performance goals and I am adept at achieving maximum operational output with minimal resource expenditure. Professional focal points include sales strategy, malfunction troubleshooting, and conflict resolution. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication skills, negotiation skills, as well as business acumen, systems analysis, project management and resource allocation to support efficiency and maximum returns. </p>
        <p>Currently, I am the Assistant Manager with Equity Lifefstyle Properties. Under my leadership, I executed the gathering and preparation of marketing, foundation development, and finance files within strict deadlines and in alignment with specific needs and requests. I also originated strategies for maximum production and organization within the leasing departments. In addition, I liaise with senior leadership, consumers, and cross-departmental teams to ensure the company’s operational support structure is driving the business forward with minimal expenditures.</p>
        <p>Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, analytical and managerial expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver positive results on time and under budget. I am currently learning full stack coding and pursuing new opportunities. All of my contact info is below, just reach out!</p>
